HEY YOU!

Congratulations (or my condolensces)! You have been chosen to be a beta tester for this epic new video game!!! ðŸ˜€
(The only reason you are a beta tester is cuz you have an IDE, that's it)

As a beta tester, it's your responsibility to check if this program runs correctly
The specifics of what you're checking will be:
    1. If the game is up to scale:
        Everything fits inside the screen, nothing is going out of boundaries, etc.
        (This is quite important cuz I was an idiot and hardcoded everything, up until I added a scaler class)
    2. Assets are loading correctly:
        Check to see if the sprites and audio cues are working as they should
    3. Powerup functionality:
        Check to see if the powerups work as intended. They should give you the ability to receive an extra hit against the cars
    4. High score system:
        Check to see if the high score is being recorded and displayed correctly. As well as the correct songs playing depending on if you
        beat the high score or didn't
    5. Cheat code:
        Check to see if the cheat code I added works (i won't tell you what the code is :D)
    Bonus: Test controller support:
        If you have a Switch Pro Controller or a PS5 dualsense, guess what? This game is compatible with those! Freakin' epic, amirite? (kill me). If you don't mind, please play with these controllers since the experience is honestly much better. Connect them via USB (could be USB-C to USB-C or USB-C to USB-C).

If you have any criticism or ideas for this game, do not hesitate to let me know! Hope you enjoy!
(do not sue me if you did not like it, that is your problem)

P.S. do NOT share this with other people *yet*. This beta is to check to see if everything works, and if it all goes swell, 
expect to see this game in itch.io (for free tho, this shit ain't worth chargning for)
